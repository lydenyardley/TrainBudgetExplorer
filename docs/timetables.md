# Timetables: what a journey time means

The fastest service in the feed, what a change means, and why the onward
search stops where it does.

## What the journey times mean

A journey time is the fastest service in the feed, with one change allowed by
default. Pass `--date YYYY-MM-DD` and the search honours each schedule's service
days, its date range, and its STP indicator, so an overlay replaces the train it
covers and a cancellation removes it. Without a date the search reads every
schedule, which suits the Stage 1 coverage count and is wrong for a specific
Saturday. Bank holidays are not interpreted yet, so a schedule that skips them
will appear on one. `adr/ADR-0006-timetable-layer.md` and
`adr/ADR-0008-date-aware-services.md` list every approximation and what removes
it.

## Why the onward search stops at 200 departures

A one-change journey is found by looking for an onward train at every place the
origin can reach. The search considers the 200 earliest departures at each
interchange. That number was measured, not guessed: on a hub-and-spoke network,
where every journey past the hub needs a change, capping at 60 dropped ten of
thirty journeys while saving under a millisecond, and capping at 200 dropped
none. Measurements for both feed shapes are in
`adr/ADR-0009-onward-departure-cap.md`, and `test_benchmark.py` fails if the
value changes without the argument changing with it.
